##Climate Change

Article.create!(title: "Climate change: Half world\'s biggest airlines don\'t offer carbon offsetting", author: "N/A", source: "BBC News", topic: "Climate Change", content: "Less than half of the world\'s major airlines are giving passengers the opportunity to offset the carbon dioxide produced from their flights, BBC research found. @@

When airlines do offer such a scheme, generally fewer than 1% of flyers are choosing to spend more.@@

Carbon offsetting enables passengers to balance out their carbon footprint by paying towards environmental projects.@@

Aviation accounts for 2% of global human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.@@

Prices vary but a return flight from London to Malaga, Spain, would cost around £4 to offset.@@

The BBC contacted the world\'s biggest airlines in terms of numbers of flights and numbers of passengers.@@

Out of the 28 approached, less than half offered a carbon offset scheme and the majority declined to provide data on the number of passengers offsetting their flights during a one year period - often saying their figures were too low to report.@@

Michael Gill, a director from the international aviation trade body Iata, said: We strongly recommend all passengers to use high-quality projects to offset their own CO2 emissions as an individual contribution to addressing climate change.@@

Carbon offsetting allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flight.@@

The money is then invested in environmental projects - like planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce the carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount.@@

Passengers can pay the additional charge when they buy their ticket from participating airlines, but independent offsetting companies also exist.@@

The price varies between airlines, but a return flight from London and Cape Town, South Africa would cost roughly £20 to offset, according to ClimateCare.@@

The CO2 emissions per passenger from that flight is roughly the same as those produced from heating the average home for a year.@@

Some activists have criticised carbon offsetting as an excuse to continue polluting, arguing that it does little to change behaviour. Advocates defend offsetting just as vociferously.@@

British Airways does not run a carbon offsetting scheme. Instead, it gives customers the opportunity to contribute towards carbon reduction and community projects@@

Lufthansa offers a carbon offsetting scheme, but uptake from passengers is less than 1%. Following the BBC\'s enquiry, the company said it would now make the offer more visible to customers during the booking process@@

Ryanair does offer a carbon offsetting scheme, but the company refused to disclose the uptake by passengers@@

American Airlines, the world\'s biggest airline, does not offer an offset scheme. The company says it has taken many meaningful steps to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, including buying new, more fuel-efficient planes@@

Emirates does not offer a scheme, but will be participating in an international carbon offset scheme from 2021@@

Qantas bucked the trend with 10% of passengers opting to offset@@

More people are flying than ever and over four billion passengers fly every year.@@

All international carriers must now report their CO2 emissions on an annual basis and the sector as a whole is aiming to halve its carbon footprint by 2050.@@

From next year, airlines will be required to offset any increase in emissions beyond their 2020 levels by reducing emissions elsewhere.@@

The new international system, known as Corsia and established by the United Nations, is the first time a single industry sector has agreed to a global measure to tackle climate change.@@

Prof Neil Harris, head of atmospheric informatics at Cranfield University, UK, says carbon offsetting is a good idea but it\'s not working. He feels airlines and governments need to do more.@@

All opt in schemes tend to have low take-up, he explained.@@

\"Secondly I think there is a  lack of clarity on what the scheme is. You want to know the money is being well spent.\"@@

Prof Kevin Anderson, who researches energy and climate change at the University of Manchester, said the most important thing was changing consumer behaviour.@@

Most people just fly occasionally but there is this small group who are very frequent fliers. And these people cannot be using offsetting to allow them to carry on business as usual, he said.@@

\"If we are serious about climate change, it is not a business-as-usual world, we will have to change how it is we operate. And until we accept that we\'re going to continue to fail on climate change and the emissions will continue to rise.\"@@", link: "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48133365", img_url: "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/1643A/production/_106749119_gettyimages-527513402.jpg", slant: "Center")

Article.create!(title: "Climate change: England flood planners \'must prepare for worst\'", author: "Roger Harrabin", source: "BBC News", topic: "Climate Change", content: "Its chairwoman, Emma Howard Boyd, said on current trends, global temperature could rise between 2C and 4C by 2100 and £1bn a year would need to be spent on flood management.@@

She said some communities may even need to move because of the risk of floods.@@

The government said it would be seeking evidence for its own flood policy in the autumn.@@

Ms Howard Boyd, launching the consultation on the agency\'s flood strategy, said government policy should ensure that all publicly-funded infrastructure is resilient to flooding and coastal change by 2050.@@

\"We can\'t win a war against water by building away climate change with infinitely high flood defences,\" she said.@@

She called for more to be done to encourage property owners to rebuild homes after flooding in better locations, and with improvements such as raised electrics, hard flooring and flood doors, rather than just \"recreating what was there before\".@@

However, she warned that in some places \"the scale of the threat may be so significant that recovery will not always be the best long term solution\" and communities would need help to \"move out of harm\'s way\".@@

The agency expects more intense bursts of rain and continuing coastal erosion.@@

It calculates that, for every person who suffers flooding, about 16 more are affected by loss of services such as power, transport and telecommunications.@@

Ms Howard Boyd warned that climate change and population growth in England meant that properties built in the floodplain will double over the next 50 years.@@

The agency points towards research from the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership which suggests that losses on UK mortgages could also double if global temperatures increase by 2C and triple if warming hits 4C.@@

These would be insurance-related losses related to outcomes of climate change such as more extreme weather.@@

Ms Howard-Boyd said the government\'s six-year flood programme had given flood and coastal protection \"a shot in the arm\", but she warned that more will be needed.@@

Environment Minister Therese Coffey said: \"Flooding and coastal erosion can have terrible consequences for people, businesses and the environment.@@

\"That\'s why we are already providing £2.6bn over six years, delivering more than 1,500 projects to better protect 300,000 homes.\"@@

But she added that \"the threat of climate change will mean an increasing risk and preparing the country is a priority for the government, and the nation as a whole\".@@

In a statement, Friends of the Earth said: \"Smarter adaptation and resilience building - including natural flood management measures like tree-planting - is undeniably important.@@

\"But the focus must be first and foremost on slashing emissions so that we can avoid the worst consequences of climate chaos in the first place.@@

\"With its relentless pursuit of fracking, airport expansion, and road building, and barely tepid support for renewable energy, our government is failing with this regard.\"@@ ", link: "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48206325", img_url: "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/13276/production/_106845487_brighton_getty.jpg", slant: "Center")



##Gun Control

Article.create!(title: "Students walk out of Colorado school shooting vigil, saying their trauma was being politicized", author: "John Bacon", source: "USA Today", topic: "Gun Control", content: "A vigil honoring Colorado high school shooting victim Kendrick Castillo dissolved into protest late Wednesday with some students walking out and others chanting \"mental health\" when speakers discussed gun control.@@

More than 2,000 attended the vigil at STEM School Highlands Ranch High School, as STEM School Highlands Ranch students burst into a spontaneous demonstration, protesting politics and the media.@@

Sen. Michael Bennet and Rep. Jason Crow spoke urged support for gun control legislation, prompting students in the crowd to shout out dissenting comments such as \"political stunt\" and \"we are people, not a statement\" – to applause.@@

Some students walk out to the parking lot, holding up lighted cellphones and yelling expletives at media folks on the scene.@@

The event, one of at least three memorials held Wednesday, was organized by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Afterward, the group issued a statement saying all efforts should be focused on providing support to the STEM students, families and faculty members.@@

\"We are deeply sorry any part of this vigil did not provide the support, caring and sense of community we sought to foster and facilitate and which we know is so crucial to communities who suffer the trauma of gun violence,\" the statement said. @@

Castillo, 18, was killed and eight students were wounded Tuesday when two teens opened fire in classrooms at the K-12 school specializing in science and math. Castillo, three days away from completing high school, and two classmates charged one of the shooters at his school. The avid hunter and fisherman was killed. @@

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed \"red flag\" legislation last month providing judges with the power to temporarily remove firearms from people believed to be at high risk of harming themselves or others. @@", link: "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/09/colorado-school-shooting-vigil-students-walk-out-protest/1150282001/  ", img_url: "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/05/09/USAT/5546dd81-258f-40e7-ba4c-59758e43491f-colorado_vigil.JPG?width=540&height=&fit=bounds&auto=webp", slant: "Center")
Article.create!(title: "Gun control takes center stage in 2020 Democratic presidential race ", author: "Amanda Becker ", source: "Reuters", topic: "Gun Control", content: " WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Cory Booker on Monday released a sweeping plan to curb gun violence by creating a national licensing program and repealing a law that gives gun manufacturers legal immunity, becoming the latest Democrat in the 2020 presidential race to make gun control measures a feature of their campaign.@@

In the past, Democrats have feared that supporting gun restrictions could cost them the backing of working-class, swing voters - the group widely credited with tipping the 2016 presidential contest to Republican Donald Trump.@@

After dozens of mass shootings in recent years, however, including at schools like the February 2018 massacre in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead, curbing gun violence has become a component of the Democratic policy platform embraced by congressional and presidential candidates.@@

\"In my community, kids fear fireworks on the Fourth of July because they sound like gunshots,\" Booker said of his hometown of Newark, New Jersey, in a news release. \"In communities across the country, from Newark to Charlotte, from San Diego to Chicago, and everywhere in between, Americans are being killed and families are being torn apart. We must do better. We need to do better.\"@@

Booker\'s plan would also ban assault weapons; allow the Consumer Product Safety Commission to regulate gun manufacturers; require microstamping technology be incorporated into new models of semi-automatic handguns; calls for universal background checks for gun sales; and close the \"boyfriend loophole\" that allows dating partners to purchase firearms after being convicted of abuse or under a restraining order. Current and former spouses convicted of abuse or under a restraining order are prohibited from purchasing a firearm.@@

Most but not all components of Booker\'s plan would require approval of the U.S. Congress. Democrats currently control the House of Representatives and Republicans the Senate, where gun safety legislation would likely meet intense pushback.@@

\"Today is more proof that the center has shifted on gun control,\" Igor Volsky, founder of Guns Down America Action Fund, said in a statement. \"Senator Booker has clearly listened to and heard from the majority of Americans that are crying out for a future with fewer guns. Fewer guns means safer communities.\"@@

Senator Kamala Harris, another 2020 contender, said last month that she too would move quickly to curb gun violence if elected to the White House.@@

Harris said she would give Congress 100 days to pass gun-control legislation, such as a universal background checks bill or a renewal of the ban on assault weapons, before using presidential executive power to act on the issue.@@

Harris said she would use executive power to require sellers of five or more weapons a year to run background checks for all gun sales; revoke the license of gun manufacturers and dealers who break the law; reverse a move by Trump to redefine \"fugitive from justice\" that allowed those with outstanding arrest warrants to buy guns; and close the boyfriend loophole.@@

An assault weapons ban was enacted in 1994 during Bill Clinton\'s presidency. It was among the reasons cited when Democrats lost congressional seats in the 1994 midterm elections. The ban expired in 2004.@@

In the 2004 presidential election, Democrat John Kerry did not make gun control a focus of his campaign and was photographed with a weapon on a hunting trip. Former President Barack Obama did not make guns a focus of his 2008 or 2012 campaigns. Hillary Clinton supported gun control measures during her 2016 campaign but did not emphasize them.@@

But gun-control advocates say the Parkland shooting and many others, including the Las Vegas concert shooting in 2017 that left 58 dead and hundreds more wounded, and another at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub in 2016 when 49 were killed have shifted public opinion on the issue.@@

Reuters/Ipsos polling in Feb. 2019 showed that 58 percent of Americans support policies that would make it more difficult to own a gun. About 69 percent said they strongly favored prohibiting individuals with a history of mental illness from buying a firearm. About 61 percent strongly or somewhat favored banning online sales of ammunition.@@

Supporting gun control measures did not hinder Democrats during the 2018 midterm congressional elections. Nearly 80 percent of the 62 newly elected Democrats included the issue in their campaign platforms. A Reuters analysis found the percentage far outstripped the proportion of Democratic candidates who did so during 2016 congressional elections.@@

After Democrats regained control of the House, they passed in March a universal background checks bill, the first major gun control legislation since the 1994 ban on assault weapons.@@

It was not taken up by the Republican-controlled Senate and Trump has threatened to veto it should it reach his desk.@@

Trump was bemoaning the legal protections afforded migrants and espousing the need for a border wall when he asked rhetorically, \"How do you stop these people?\" @@

\"Shoot them!\" someone shouted from the Panama City Beach crowd, according to multiple news media reports. @@

The remark drew a chuckle from the president, who then shook his head, pointed in the audience member\'s direction and said, \"Only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement.\" @@

\"Only in the Panhandle,\" he repeated to laughs and cheers from the crowd. @@

Prior to the interruption, Trump had mentioned \"border security people\" who he said are not permitted to use weapons on the migrants. @@

Article.create!(title: "New York\'s Rideshare Organizers Clash Amid Unprecedented Uber Strike", author: "Bryan Menegus", source: "Gizmodo", topic: "Tech", content: "Long Island City—Just days before Uber\'s expected debut on the stock market at a conservative but still-astronomical $80 to $90 billion valuation, the anger among rideshare drivers boiled over into an international day of action. @@

In at least 20 cities around the world, Uber drivers with few employment protections and no real way to contact one another came together on Wednesday to demand fairer conditions. That action on this scale could be coordinated at all is, on its own, an astounding achievement. A grand expression of frustration can be cathartic in its own way, but at times the balkanized pockets of organizers appeared to be rowing in opposite directions—nowhere more starkly than in the company\'s largest market: New York City.@@

Ask rideshare drivers anywhere, and they\'ll likely name the same problems: low pay made lower through vehicle expenses and upkeep, deactivations without recourse, and a higher and higher share of their rides being gobbled up as commission fees. But ask about the best strategy to improve their working conditions, and the answers will probably be less consistent.@@

In three cities in Australia, a handful of drivers delivered a letter expressing \"concern about the lack of rights and standards that apply to transport workers in the gig economy\" to Uber Greenlight hubs. In Los Angeles, one of the best organized and most militant groups, Rideshare Drivers United, called a 24-hour strike for its estimated 4,200 members. Philadelphia Drivers United responsibly split the difference, opting to hold a rally but not call a strike, as many of its constituent members were \"one missed day of work away from vehicle repossession or missed medications.\" Unfocused, maybe, but not openly hostile towards one another.@@

New York, however, had the dubious honor of being the only city to host competing rallies between labor groups—the Independent Drivers Guild (IDG) and the New York Taxi Drivers Alliance (NYTWA)—which took turns to protest in front of an Uber hub in Long Island City, Queens, rather than join together.@@

\"As New York drivers we\'re standing in solidarity with drivers all across the country,\" Aaron Smith, the IDG\'s director of organizing, told me—apparently referring to every local grassroots group except the NYTWA.@@

Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of NYTWA, believed the majority of her organization\'s 10,000 members shut off their apps during their declared strike hours from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. today, and took credit for an alleged 2.2x driver surge meant to encourage to get drivers out on the road. Citing just a 500-car dip from last week\'s numbers, Uber denied the strike\'s efficacy, and in fact refused to attribute the change to labor activity. Whether the strike had a meaningful impact on Uber\'s business this morning or not, at least three hashtags associated with the strike on Twitter were trending across the city. Little to none of that visibility can be chalked up to the IDG, which did not strike today.@@

\"We\'ll continue to make sure that driving is a career and it\'s a path to the middle class and not a path to the poverty wages that these companies want you to live in,\" Brendan Sexton, the IDG\'s executive director, addressed a crowd of approximately 150 drivers clad in complementary union t-shirts. The IDG, formed almost three years ago to the day, are a divisive organization to say the least. Formed through an arrangement between the International Association of Machinists, drivers, and Uber itself, the IDG are the only union-associated group recognized by the ridesharing platform. But their recognition hinged on signing an agreement with a no-strike clause and refusal to criticize systemic problems on the app. It\'s branded them among skeptics—like the NYTWA—as Uber lackeys.@@

\"They are paid by Uber,\" Desai told me, when asked why the rallies were not coordinated. \"They are a sham company union which goes against every single principle that people like us believe in, because we\'re supposed to be working for the interests of the workers. We\'re not supposed to be taking money from the bosses.\" \"We\'re built by drivers and we work for drivers,\" Sexton shot back. \"That other group they represent, I think, medallion owners, or yellow cabs or something,\" he bristled, adding incorrectly that the NYTWA \"don\'t really do app-based drivers yet.\" The NYTWA did indeed get its start representing cabbies; no rideshare companies existed when it was founded, in 1998.@@

Sexton did confirm however, that the IDG does still receive money from Uber. \"Like every other union contract there are contributions from the employer. Most of our funding—over 75 percent—comes from grants, member contributions, donations, and contributions from the Machinists Union.\" During Desai\'s address to the media at 1 p.m. today, members of Sexton\'s guild hung back with banners and whistles, sporadically interrupting speeches.@@

Of course, the stories from drivers in either organization are nearly identical. \"After a while, learning the kind of expenses I accumulate I was like \'Oh, I\'m making almost nothing,\'\" IDG member Jacky Lin told me. \"Gas I\'ll spend like $1,000. Insurance I\'ll spend like $300. Car payments, another couple hundred.\" He estimates that, with those various deductions, he takes home a little over $1,000 per month. \"Lucky for me I was living at home,\" Lin said, \"but if it wasn\'t for that I don\'t think I\'d be able to survive.\"@@

Holding two printed-out sheets before a gaggle of reporters at an earlier event in front of the iconic Charging Bull statue, Inder Parmar, a NYTWA member, claimed his earnings had shrunk from $37 an hour when he began driving for Uber to just over $9 an hour now. In reference to the rash of suicides that took the lives of seven for-hire drivers, he said, \"if my kids and my family didn\'t support me, I would be one of the dead drivers.\"@@

The divide between the two labor groups is largely idealogical: a hardline approach versus one that\'s open to meeting the boss halfway. When I asked Lin why he\'d opted to join a group that wasn\'t willing (or able) to strike, a nearby staffer interrupted, noting that \"obviously, if you\'re at a rally, you\'re not working. So if you want to call it a strike, it really doesn\'t make any kind of difference.\" And yet what led the spark of protest to travel from Los Angeles to multiple continents arguably wasn\'t \"not working,\" it was the threat of a strike, and all the weight that suggests.@@

\"We know we got to them. That\'s the triumph,\" Desai told reporters gathered in Queens. \"We got into their heads. We messed with them. We punched back, and we showed them that we\'re not afraid.\"@@

Both groups were adamant that today\'s action was just the beginning, which even Uber itself seems keenly aware of. \"As we aim to reduce Driver incentives to improve our financial performance, we expect Driver dissatisfaction will generally increase,\" the company wrote in its S-1 filing, setting the stage for increasingly widespread outrage. But it\'s also the beginning of some very difficult coalition-building for these various national and international groups to agree on and pursue unified demands—or risk losing their own momentum to conflict and confusion.@@

Article.create!(title: "FTC Members Unanimously Press Congress for Tough National Privacy Protections", author: "Dell Cameron", source: "Gizmodo", topic: "Tech", content: "All five members of the Federal Trade Commission appeared Wednesday before the House Communications and Technology Subcommittee. One or two would have probably done the job. When it comes to consumer privacy—the hearing\'s dominant focus—the commissioners\' opinions, however uniquely expressed, rarely diverge when it matters the most. @@

On the issue of a tough new privacy law to control how major tech companies handle the voluminous data collected on Americans each year, all five unanimously agree: such a law is desperately needed. In fact, no hearing\'s attendees on either side of the room bothered to play at devil\'s advocate. That exercise would have been entirely fruitless. @@

In a political climate that demonstrably prefers, if not rewards, the scoring of cheap political points over any substantive policy debate, watching policymakers of rival parties firmly agree on something as vital as the future of privacy is plumb refreshing. It feels a little like being wafted by a misting fan after overexposure to a hot summer\'s sun. @@

When it came to typically hot-button questions like, \"Do you all support a federal preemption of existing state laws?\" the only reservation, from Republicans and Democrats alike, hovered around a fear that a national privacy law would end up being somehow lesser than the state laws it would, hypothetically, supersede. @@

\"I\'m trying to figure out how it works if we don\'t do a nationwide law,\" Greg Walden, the ranking Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, pondered aloud at one point. The internet doesn\'t care much for state lines, he conceded. In a way, it\'s entire purpose is to obsolete the modes of commerce and communication traditionally hindered by such political demarcation.@@

\"Who knew?\" he then joked. @@

\"If the legislation is substantial enough, then I think it makes sense to preempt,\" said FTC Chairman Joseph Simons. With some caveats, his four fellow commissioners all agreed. \"Consumers are looking for a seamless experience,\" said Christine Wilson, a Republican—who went on to describe how, in one case, two state laws determining whether users need to \"opt-in\" or \"opt-out\" were conflicting, leaving businesses in something of a catch-22 scenario. They \"literally cannot comply with both of those state laws,\" she said. @@

Likewise concerned that a national law could lower privacy standards in some states, Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, smartly suggested that the question should hinge entirely on whether such a law can be passed that, in quality, exceeds, or is at least meets, the sensible state laws already in the books. Noah Phillips, a Republican commissioner, concurred, stressing that the need to supplant a messy patchwork of state laws is \"essential.\" @@

Mostly in agreement, Democrat Rohit Chopra, meanwhile, recalled that during the subprime mortgage crisis, the government\'s broad preemption of state laws designed to safeguard borrowers only served to imperil them further. When one wonders why Congress hasn\'t already slapped something together, this is one reason that—despite the deluge of transgressions committed by companies like Facebook on a continual basis—a hastily prepared law isn\'t the answer. It could, in fact, do more harm than good. @@

Collectively, the commissioners are seeking to enhance their authority to pursue privacy violators at big companies and nonprofits alike; grow its budget for the hiring of new staff and technologies devoted largely to the issues of consumer privacy; as well as make its rulemaking requirements less stringent so it can, in effect, actually enforce whatever new law Congress spits out. @@

The FTC is run by a crowd with a healthy fear of wielding a large weapon. Whereas now the agency is trying to excise cancerous scammers and recidivist privacy violators with a pair of salad tongs and a baseball mitt, what it really needs is a proper scalpel. Like oh so many small-town police departments flooded with surplus military armaments, what it has absolutely no use for is a tank. History knows better. @@

\"There was a time when the FTC was given broad rulemaking authority, but stepped past bounds of what Congress and the public supported,\" said Walden, referring to laws passed some 40 years ago that, justifiably or not, markedly diminished the agency\'s power. \"Do you have any concerns with Congress delegating broad rulemaking authority to the FTC?\" he asked. @@

\"I have substantial concerns,\" the chairman replied, soberly. \"And please do not do it.\" @@

Commissioner Wilson raised the example of a new impediment, the result of a Third Circuit court ruling enabling the agency to go after, say, a business engaged in fraud—but only if it can prove that the illicit activity is ongoing or imminent. \"Say a fraudster stops defrauding people or an advertiser suspends its dubious advertising claims,\" she said; under the court-imposed standard, \"we\'re unable to go after that conduct.\" @@

\"We believe this flies against a long line of cases saying otherwise, but we would appreciate clarification from Congress,\" Wilson said. @@

Repeatedly, Simons raised the matter of his agency\'s limited funding. In comparison to some agencies, such as the Justice Department, whose budget ranges in the dozens of billions of dollars each year, the FTC operates on a relatively small purse. Its FY 2020 budget request was for only $312 million. (By some estimates, that\'s how much Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, history\'s richest man, makes every few days.) @@

Without more resources, Simons said at one point, the FTC would be forced to abandon other avenues of enforcement, such as pursuing scammers that rip off senior citizens, if it were to be forced to shift its attention to focus greater on consumer privacy. \"Our authority is limited,\" he said. \"If we get more authority, we\'ll need more resources.\" @@

In regard to a new law, what the FTC doesn\'t want to be stuck with is making decisions about what \"privacy\" really is, what it really means to Americans when you weigh their interests collectively.

The recommendations seek to even out anomalies in protection for British travelers, highlighted when Monarch collapsed in 2017, but airlines rejected the review\'s proposed \"airline seat levy\" which it said would cost less than 50 pence per passenger. @@

\"Although airline insolvencies are relatively rare... they do happen – and at times have required government to step in to repatriate passengers at great cost to the taxpayer,\" Peter Bucks, who chaired the review, said in a statement. @@

British transport minister Chris Grayling said he would consider the proposals by the Airline Insolvency Review, which was set up by finance minister Philip Hammond after the government and the Civil Aviation Authority had to step in to help repatriate Monarch customers. @@

British holidaymakers who are booked onto a package holiday have what is called Air Travel Organiser\'s License (ATOL) protection, ensuring they can return home and do not lose money. @@

Monarch, which had both ATOL-protected and flight-only customers, highlighted the discrepancy in British law. @@

The CAA did not assist in repatriating customers of airlines such as Flybmi when it went bust earlier this year. @@

Instead, airline passengers often have to rely on their banks, payment card issuers or insurers for refunds, with other airlines often cutting fares in offers to stranded passengers. @@

The review also suggests that airlines should provide a security to be called on in the event of its insolvency. @@

Article.create!(title: "CDC: 1.1 million more Americans lost health insurance coverage in 2018", author: "Ken Alltucker", source: "USA Today", topic: "Health", content: "The number of Americans without health insurance increased again in 2018, the second consecutive year that figure has risen after several years of declines under Obamacare, a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey shows. @@

An estimated 30.4 million Americans did not have health insurance in 2018, up from 29.3 million in 2017, according to the CDC\'s National Health Interview Survey.  That means about 1.1 million more Americans lost insurance coverage last year. @@

Trump administration and congressional efforts to challenge and loosen requirements of the Affordable Care Act likely played a role in some going without coverage, analysts say. @@

\"I don\'t think it\'s too shocking with efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\" said Daniel Derksen, a University of Arizona professor and health policy expert. @@

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the health law\'s individual mandate that required people get health insurance or pay a penalty. It also formed the legal basis for a coalition of Republican-led states to argue in federal court that the entire health law should be tossed out – a court challenge that the Trump administration now supports. @@

Derksen said a strong economy means more low-income people likely moved from Medicaid coverage to health insurance through a job. That won\'t necessarily make health care more affordable for those whose health plans shift costs to them through higher deductibles and co-payments. @@

The CDC survey said the number of Americans in a high-deductible plans reached an all-time high, covering 45.8% of people with private health insurance in 2018. In 2010, 25% of people with private coverage had high-deductible plans. @@

A Gallup survey found that Americans borrowed $88 billion to pay health care last year and one in four people skipped care because of cost. @@

High-deductible plans are popular among companies seeking to defray the spiraling cost of health care, but a recent survey by Kaiser Family Foundation and the Los Angeles Times found that many employees in high-deductible plans have postponed care or cut spending on household expenses such as food and clothing. @@

\"Employees are taking on more and more of the burden of health care costs,\" says Cynthia Cox, Kaiser Family Foundation\'s director of health reform and private insurance. \"We might be reaching a breaking point. At some point, employers won\'t be able to raise deductibles higher and higher.\" @@

The CDC survey was based on data from 72,762 people who were asked whether they were insured at the time. @@

The uninsured rate among U.S. working-age adults was 13.3% in 2018, up from 12.8% in 2017. Among all ages, the uninsured rate was 9.4 percent, but that figure includes seniors on Medicare and children with Children\'s Health Insurance Program coverage. @@

Among 17 states with figures reported in the survey, Texas had the highest uninsured rate among working-age adults, 25%, and Massachusetts the lowest, 4.9%. @@

The CDC survey followed a Congressional Budget Office report issued last month last month that found a similar decline in health coverage after years of gains under the Affordable Care Act. @@", link: "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/09/health-insurance-1-1-million-more-americans-lost-coverage-2018/1140304001/", img_url: "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/04/05/USAT/ccd08820-27da-42e1-8d41-e6678c7b2a35-Nebraska_040519.jpg?width=540&height=&fit=bounds&auto=webp", slant: "Center")

Article.create!(title: "How to pay for college without going broke? Let us count the ways", author: "Charisse Jones", source: "USA Today", topic: "Education", content: "When her two sons were younger, Sarah McCord says she was a stay-at-home mom. But as soon as her oldest hit high school, she went back to work with one goal in mind: using her pay to cover the kids\' college tuition. @@

\"The cost of school, I think, is exorbitant, and I can\'t imagine how (a student) would recoup that if a kid were to finance that on their own,\'\' says McCord, whose salary from her job at a pharmaceutical company covers her younger son\'s roughly $17,000 a semester in tuition, room and board. \"Entry level salaries just aren\'t going to make a dent in those payments.\'\'@@

With Americans carrying $1.57 trillion in outstanding student loan debt, many families and students continue to borrow to cover the ever-escalating costs of college tuition. But some are also figuring out more creative ways to pay for higher education, from crowdfunding to corporate reimbursement programs to stashing cash back from purchases they make every day. @@

\"As college costs continue to rise and there seems to be no end in sight, the gap is going to get narrower and narrower at the top of who can really even afford this anymore,\'\' says Susan Dabbar,  founder and CEO of AdmissionSmarts, which helps families navigate the college admissions process, from applications to affordability. \"More and more people are going to be looking for all of these different ways...to figure out how are we really going to pay for this.\'\'

So how are you going to pay for college?
Last year, 57% of financial aid funding for undergraduate students came from grants, 34% from loans, 7.9% from education tax benefits and less than 1% from student jobs, says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher and vice president of research for Savingforcollege.com. @@

Scholarships, offered by everyone from states to fraternal organizations, can also help cut the cost of tuition. And Jeff Levy, an independent educational consultant says \"the most creative way to finance a college education is to find the colleges that are the most generous with financial aid, both need-based and non-need-based.\'\'@@

The average discount from the published cost of attendance is 44% he says. \"So for families who are smart about how to shop for college, they can easily cut the cost ... in half by putting sensible colleges on their child\'s list.\'\'@@

But Americans are also saving, utilizing tools like 529 plans, which offer tax advantages to families that invest in stocks and bonds.@@

\"Eighteen percent of children under the age of 18 have 529 plans,\'\' Kantrowitz says, \"a relatively low number but it\'s been growing. Every dollar you save is a dollar less you\'re going to have to borrow.\'\'@@


Kathleen Surdan, who lives with her family in Acton, Massachusetts opened 529 plans for her three children. But she also saved more than $4,000 over 12 years through Upromise, a site that enables users to buy products and services from various retailers online, then get cash back from those purchases that goes into an account.@@

\"It takes 10 seconds to go through that link,\'\' said Surdan, who started out getting a few cents back for purchasing orange juice and eventually saved up to $400 a year booking family trips as well as hotels for her daughter\'s out of town softball games. When you finally need to tap the funds, she says, \"they send you a check.\'\'@@

Surdan\'s two daughters, now 23 and 25, and her 20-year-old son received some scholarships. They also had to pay for their own books and come up with their own spending money. But Surdan says she and her husband paid much of their children\'s tuition with savings.@@

\"My husband read an article when they were little ... saying you need $400 a month starting now,  when they\'re born, and my husband took that to heart and we started putting money in,\'\' she says. \"Once your kid is born and you think they might go to college, you have 18 years to figure out a plan.\'\'@@

McCord said her family was unable to build savings during the years her family lived solely on one income.@@

\"We had no savings at all,\'\' says McCord who has two sons, Isaac, 24 and Silas, 19.@@

When she did return to work to put aside money for their looming tuition, \"I was open to anything,\'\' she says noting that she worked as an office manager before landing her current job in human resources.@@

It cost roughly $17,000 a semester including room and board for her oldest son to attend Liberty University, and about the same amount for her youngest who currently goes to Johnson University in Knoxville, Tennessee. McCord\'s pay \"covers all of it,\'\' she says. \"They both got a little bit of scholarship (money) from the schools, a little bit of financial aid … but what I make covers their tuition.\'\'@@

Non-traditional ways to pay for college
Students are also seeking out novel ways to cover the costs of their education.@@

\"There are lots of students using crowdfunding, some with amazing results,\'\' says Dabbar noting the rise of GoFundMe and other campaigns. One student she worked with had a $12,000 gap between what merit aid would cover and what she needed. \"She had a very compelling story....She put up a GoFundMe page, and she didn\'t\' reach her goal of $12,000, but she raised close to $8,000, which got her that much closer to funding her first year of college.\'\'@@

Students who work while in school might also want to be strategic in the positions they aim for.@@

\"I always tell students to get a (part-time) job at the college, not as a student worker, but as an employee,\'\' says Jill Geers, a college adviser at Joliet Junior College in Joliet, Illinois, near Chicago. @@

Students need to check what, if any, tuition discount the college gives those on staff.Geers says at her school, a part-time employee gets one free class per semester. \"As a full-time employee, myself and my dependents attend tuition-free....There are so many attainable jobs on every campus.\'\'@@

Several companies also reimburse employees for their tuition costs. Starbucks, for instance, has a program that enables eligible staff members to attend Arizona State University online, with both tuition assistance from the company and a university scholarship. Meanwhile, Chipotle\'s \"Cultivate Me\'\' initiative, which kicked off April 1, reimburses employees for up to $5,250 in tuition annually. @@

\"If you\'ve got a student trying to get a college degree and you\'re a barista at Starbucks, this is a really good opportunity,\'\' says Dabbar. \"Work study in a lot of colleges isn\'t very generous, but if you think outside the box, and you go out to the corporate world and ... here are three Chipotles within three miles of campus. What if Susie gets a job at Chipotle and then gets into their tuition-reimbursement program? It\'s kind of a different way of thinking.\'\'@@

For those students who may think of attending community college to save money then transferring to a four-year institution, it\'s important to do their homework beforehand, such as making sure their credits will actually carry over. But it can be cost-effective.@@

A collaboration between Texas A&M and nearby Blinn community college, for instance, allows some students who have applied to the four-year university to co-enroll at both schools. They take the bulk of their classes and pay the lower tuition at the community college but also enroll in courses at Texas A&M, participating in that campus\' activities. The goal is that the students will eventually attend A&M full time.@@

Depending on the college, Advanced Placement courses and exams taken in high school can also shave the number of credits students have to take once arriving on campus, saving money.@@

With tuition in the 2018-2019 school year rising 2.5% at a public, four-year, in-state college on average, and 3.3% at a private nonprofit school, crowdfunding, cash-back offers and other alternate ways of saving may only go so far. But every little bit helps. @@

\"You\'re probably going to have to save and borrow,\'\' says Kantrowitz, \"but they can be good ways of helping to defray the costs.\”\'@@

Article.create!(title: "These teachers\' jobs give fair salary, housing, respect. All they had to do was leave U.S.", author: "Erin Richards", source: "USA Today", topic: "Education", content: "QUITO, Ecuador – Kip Mapstone has lived a double life as a science teacher.@@

When he worked in Oregon\'s public schools, he taught six classes, each with between 30 to 40 students, plus homeroom. With little downtime during the day, grading and lesson planning happened at home most nights.@@

Today, Mapstone teaches five science classes, each with no more than 17 students. He has ample time to prepare and to collaborate with colleagues during the day, leaving his evenings free to spend time with family. He also receives a housing subsidy, plus free private-school tuition for his children.@@

Mapstone didn\'t just move to a new school for these benefits – he moved to a different country. He teaches at Academia Cotopaxi, an international K-12 school in Quito, Ecuador, where high-quality U.S. teachers are in high demand.@@

While teachers in America face stagnant wages, a divisive political environment and continued pressure to boost test scores, an expanding marketplace of international schools stands ready to capitalize on their discontent. The schools offer a host of benefits to attract experienced teachers, including two coveted ones that don\'t cost a penny: autonomy and respect.@@

\"The need for teachers is massive,\" said Madeleine Maceda Heide, director of Academia Cotopaxi.@@

In Quito alone there are five international schools, but Cotopaxi, which is named for one of the country\'s most famous volcanoes, is one of the best known. Its colonial-style campus stretches across almost 10 acres, with a backdrop of the Andes mountains. Like most international schools, Cotopaxi is private and charges tuition – the equivalent of about $18,000 in the U.S. for high school – and teachers conduct all instruction in English.@@

Historically, international schools were located in capital cities and educated the children of parents working in the foreign service or on corporate assignments. But now the schools are popping up in all kinds of cities where a burgeoning number of middle- and upper-class parents are seeking to opt out of public schools and pay for an American-style private education.@@

At Cotopaxi, about 40% of students are foreigners. The other 60% are local Ecuadorian students. @@

\"Locals want an international education for their child,\" said Heide, the Cotopaxi school director. \"They want English and multiple languages. They want their child to work in the international world. It\'s true in India and China and the Middle East, where the local school systems may not be what parents want.\"@@

All of that growth in international schools means more opportunities for U.S. teachers, particularly ones with certifications in specialty subjects such as special education or math or science. @@

The number of international schools has doubled over the past decade, from about 5,000 to more than 10,200 this year, according to International Schools Consultancy, a company that provides data on the schools. Those schools employ more than half a million full-time staff; the consultancy predicts the institutions will need at least 896,000 teachers by 2028.@@

\"These schools are resource-rich,\" said Rajiv Bhat, chief operating officer of Search Associates, a recruitment company for international schools. The organization helps place about 3,000 teachers each year.@@

\"The parents are affluent,\" Bhat added. \"They can pay the kind of fees that allow these schools to pay teachers a good salary and good benefits.@@

\"Plus, they have a small student population. That\'s one of the greatest benefits for a teacher: 15 to 20 kids, rather than 30 to 40 kids.\"@@

Teachers who want to work in an international school commonly start by submitting an application to one of the recruitment firms that help match educators with schools abroad. Semi-annual fairs allow teachers to meet with representatives of the international schools, where the exchanges can be a little like speed-dating.@@

More interviews follow, and when teachers are offered a contract, it\'s usually for two years.@@

For some teachers, the courtship process happens even faster.@@

Nate Bowling is a high school social studies teacher in Tacoma, Washington, with a list of accolades, including a 2016 state teacher of the year award. He\'s an outspoken education policy critic with more than 17,000 followers on Twitter, and he writes extensively about race relations and the need for equitable resources for students.@@

Bowling said he\'s well-compensated and will earn around $90,000 this year.@@

And he\'s leaving it all.@@

On April 9 Bowling announced on his website that he\'s moving to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates to teach Advanced Placement government and global issues at American Community School. His wife will come, too. She\'ll teach English at the same school.@@

\"I love the school, the staff, and especially my students,\" Bowling wrote on his website. \"But I realized at some point this year that in order to stay in the classroom, I needed to do something different.\"@@

In an interview, Bowling said he and his wife submitted their applications to a search firm last fall and were contacted almost immediately by schools abroad. He interviewed three times over Skype with a school in Shanghai, which didn\'t work out. Then he interviewed four times with the school in Abu Dhabi.@@

The political environment in the U.S. played into his decision to leave.@@

\"The American school model as it was practiced in the past is the envy of the world, and everybody wants to copy it,\" Bowling said.@@

\"The American school present is not. And it\'s driving out effective people because the work we ask people to do, particularly at low-income schools like my school, is unsustainable.\"@@

For American educators accustomed to working in low-income schools, the resources available at some international schools can seem luxurious. One day at Cotopaxi in March, a classroom of fourth-grade students were puzzling over a writing exercise. There were only 15 students in the class, but a teacher and an instructional assistant were available to help.@@

Elsewhere in the school that afternoon, high school students were working on advanced math and kindergartners were painting in a glass-walled atelier.@@

As for testing, Cotopaxi teachers use Measures of Academic Progress, which students take three times per year to measure their improvement. Many U.S. schools administer that exam or something similar, plus annual state standardized exams and other mandated tests.@@

Cotopaxi also has a deep bench of support staff. The school employs two doctors and five counselors. Two of those counselors only work with the high school, which enrolls just 160 students.@@

Kourtney Wessels, Cotopaxi\'s English-language learner coordinator, said she appreciates all the resources at her school. Parents are dedicated and support the school financially. Students arrive at school fed and ready to learn, and misbehavior is rare.@@

But sometimes she wonders if she made the right decision to leave the U.S.@@

\"I went into teaching with the idea of social justice,\" said Wessels, whose parents were both public-school teachers. \"Here you\'re kind of living in a bubble. I still struggle with that.\" @@

Several teachers interviewed at Cotopaxi said they valued being treated like professionals and having autonomy in the classroom.@@

They even applauded their professional-development sessions, a common target of U.S. teachers\' complaints. At Cotopaxi, the sessions are more relevant and robust, teachers said. @@

Teachers also said they felt like administrators of international schools listened to them and incorporated their feedback more readily than principals in the States.@@

Almost everyone said they enjoyed the close kinship that occurs among teachers in international schools, likely fueled by the fact that virtually all of them share an adventurous spirit.@@

International school teachers sometimes earn less than what they earned in the States. At Cotopaxi, salaries range from about $26,000 to $56,000, depending on a teacher\'s education and experience.@@

But other benefits – such as free housing, free tuition for teachers\' children to attend the school, and a free plane ticket home once per year – help teachers keep more of that pay in their pockets. Some schools throw in other benefits as well.@@

\"I get a transportation budget to get to and from work,\" said Vanessa Weber, a special education teacher at The International School of Kuala Lumpur, in Malaysia. @@

\"Our housing is covered, I have the best health insurance I\'ve ever had, and it covers me in every part of the world,\" she added. \"And we get an amazing retirement: My school pays 17% and then I can contribute to it as well.\" @@

Weber, who is from Wisconsin, taught at Cotopaxi with her husband before they both got offers to work in Malaysia. The biggest downside now is that home is a 30-hour flight away.@@

Still, international teaching jobs in Asia are coveted because salaries are high. Weber said base salaries at her school range from the equivalent of $25,580 in U.S. dollars for a teacher with no experience to $80,000 for an experienced teacher with a doctorate degree.@@

Then the benefits: a housing allowance, retirement plan, transportation allowance, flights home, tuition for teachers\' children (at the Kuala Lumpur school, that\'s about $40,000 per child) and also shipping and settling-in allowances for new hires.@@

In her five years overseas, Weber said she\'s noticed more-experienced teachers from the U.S. joining the international circuit.@@

\"Usually you start doing this kind of teaching when you\'re young, and you do it for part of your life,\" Weber said. \"Now I\'m meeting people in their early 40s who are teaching abroad for the first time. It\'s clear that there\'s a greater exodus than there was before.\"@@", link: "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/05/06/teacher-salary-teaching-jobs-pay-international-schools-benefits/3622262002/", img_url: "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/04/30/USAT/b5c308ca-d155-4b3e-b10a-145e0c22c6b5-XXX_CP_Teaching_Abroad_Ecuador_62.JPG?width=540&height=&fit=bounds&auto=webp", slant: "Center")
