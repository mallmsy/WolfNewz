Article.create!(title: "Biodiversity Loss Is Urgent. Spreading the Message Is Hard.", author: "Brad Plumer and Somini Sengupta", source: "The New York Times", summary:

"It’s been 27 years since the first global treaty to protect biodiversity. Where are we now?", topic: "Climate Change", content: "On Monday, I wrote about a sweeping new United Nations report warning that humans were destroying Earth’s natural ecosystems at an “unprecedented” pace. The findings were sobering: As many as one million plant and animal species are now threatened with extinction because of farming, hunting, pollution and, increasingly, climate change. Almost everywhere you look, nature is vanishing before our eyes.

But the report, which was written for world leaders and policymakers, also wrestled with another big question: Why should anyone care about the loss of nature? Why should countries take drastic steps, as the report urges, to halt the decline in biodiversity?

The scientists and experts who wrote the report spent a lot of effort trying to frame biodiversity loss as an urgent issue for human well-being. Natural ecosystems, they explained, provide invaluable material services to people, from mangrove forests that protect millions from coastal flooding to wild insects that pollinate our crops. When we destroy nature, they concluded, we undermine our own quality of life.

That’s a compelling argument, and it’s one that many conservationists and ecologists have emphasized in recent years. There’s now an entire field of research around “ecosystem services;” scientists try to quantify in dollar terms all the benefits that nature provides to humanity, in order to make an economic case for conservation. It’s worth noting that some ecologists have long been skeptical of this line of thinking, and have countered that it’s simply wrong to drive other species to extinction even if they’re not crucial for economic growth or humanity’s survival. And the new report does acknowledge that nature also has a spiritual or inspirational value that can often be “difficult to quantify.”

But it’s been 27 years since the first global treaty to protect biodiversity, and the world’s nations are still faltering in their efforts to halt the decline of natural ecosystems around the globe. That helps explains why the authors of this latest report felt they had to appeal more forcefully to humanity’s own naked self-interest.

“Life on Earth is an intricate fabric, and it’s not like we’re looking at it from the outside,” Sandra M. Díaz, a lead author of the report and an ecologist at the National University of Córdoba in Argentina, told me. “We are threads in that fabric. If the fabric is getting holes and fraying, that affects us all.”", link: "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/climate/nyt-climate-newsletter.html", img_url: "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/08/climate/08cli-newsletter-biodiversity/e105419419bf41b7b81f0e67f61929cf-jumbo.jpg", slant: "Left")

Article.create!(title: "Climate change missing as US defends Arctic policy", author: "Matthew Lee", source: "Washington Post", summary: "The Arctic is melting, but don’t ask U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to talk about climate change. Nor even to agree on a text that mentions it.", topic: "Climate Change", content: "The Arctic is melting, but don’t ask U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to talk about climate change. Nor even to agree on a text that mentions it.

For the Trump administration, disappearing sea ice in the world’s “high north” appears to be first and foremost an economic opportunity to exploit rather than a crisis to mitigate.

That position was made clear by Pompeo over two days of meetings in the northern Finnish Arctic city of Rovaniemi involving the foreign ministers of the eight members of the Arctic Council — Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States.

“Steady reductions in sea ice are opening new naval passageways and new opportunities for trade, potentially slashing the time it takes for ships to travel between Asia and the West by 20 days,” he said in a speech Monday, which was met with polite but muted applause.

“Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st century’s Suez and Panama canals.”

Finnish Foreign Minister Timo Soini, whose country is wrapping up its two-year chairmanship of the council, said Tuesday there was no joint declaration given the inability to get the U.S. to agree on a text that included language about climate change.

Instead, a brief joint statement reaffirmed a “commitment to maintain peace, stability and constructive co-operation in the Arctic.”

Soini told reporters that he didn’t want to “name and blame anybody” and called the outcome “good enough” for all parties. Finland’s chairmanship of the council had largely focused on climate change concerns.

A senior U.S. official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, downplayed the failure to craft a declaration and defended Pompeo’s omission of “climate change” from remarks.


“Just because you don’t have a certain phrase in it, you can’t infer that the United States has taken a position that is anti-environment,” the official said.

Pompeo did acknowledge environmental concerns, and told the meeting Tuesday that “the Trump Administration shares your deep commitment to environmental stewardship.”

“The Arctic has always been a fragile ecosystem, and protecting it is indeed our shared responsibility,” Pompeo said.

Over the summit, Pompeo also defended President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord in 2017, a day after a U.N. biodiversity report warned that extinction loomed for over 1 million species of plants and animals.

“Collective goals, even when well-intentioned, are not always the answer,” Pompeo said. “They are rendered meaningless, even counterproductive, as soon as one nation fails to comply.”


Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said his country is “open to the widest kind of cooperation in the Arctic” and that “there are no reasons for conflicts and for getting military methods involved in solving any issues arising here.”

Bill Erasmus, the chairman of the Arctic Athabaskan Council, a Canada-based group of indigenous people, expressed disappointment that a joint declaration had not been reached.

“We recognize that climate change is real,” he said. “Climate change is man-made, and our elders tell us that we are clearly in trouble.”

Official U.S. statements and documents prepared for the meeting did not refer to “climate change” and their scientific focus was limited to reductions in U.S. carbon emissions that predate the administration.

According to statistics Pompeo presented, U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions fell by 14% between 2005 and 2017, while global energy-related CO2 emissions increased more than 20%. In terms of black carbon, which is a particular threat to the Arctic, U.S. emissions were 16% below 2013 levels in 2016 and are projected to nearly halve by 2025, he said.


“I’m sure it was a good party,” Pompeo said of the negotiations in Paris. “I’m sure it felt good to sign the agreement. But at the end of the day, what matters to human health, what matters to the citizens of the world, is that we actually have an impact on improving health. And our technology, our innovation, the R&D we put in in the United States, that’s what will drive better climatic outcomes, that’s what will create cleaner air and safer drinking water, and that’s what I hope the whole world will focus on.”

Pompeo again declined the opportunity to mention “climate change” on Tuesday when he met with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland who pointedly referred to the phenomenon as she played down a dispute with the United States over the sovereignty of the Northwest Passage.

“We have a very close, very fruitful collaboration,” she said. “And actually, as we see the conditions of the Northwest Passage changing with our changing climate, I think that’s actually grounds for closer collaboration with the United States.”


Pompeo replied by saying the U.S. is more concerned about Russia and China in the Arctic than ownership of the Northwest Passage.

“The challenges in the Arctic aren’t between the United States and Canada, let me assure you,” he said. “There are others that threaten to use it in ways that are not consistent with the rule of law.”

Canada’s Freeland also noted that “unpredictable weather patterns caused by climate change” are causing security threats and navigational issues.

Iceland’s foreign minister, Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson, was bleak in his assessment.

“We can expect due to climate change more drastic changes in the next two decades than we have seen in the last 100 years,” he said.", link: "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/climate-change-missing-as-us-defends-arctic-policy/2019/05/07/5ad97c1a-709d-11e9-9331-30bc5836f48e_story.html", img_url: "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vIgBQi9OBwljbjfxVzkS1FeMUa4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YNLDF5DQVEI6TEZRGC6FQNXURY.jpg", slant: "Left")

Article.create!(title: "From the border, more frustrating immigration numbers for President Trump", author: "Nick Miroff", source: "Washington Post", summary: "The number of border-crossers taken into U.S. custody topped 100,000 for the second consecutive month in April, U.S. border officials said Wednesday, deepening the crisis that has derailed President Trump’s immigration agenda and has defied his myriad attempts to fix it.", topic: "Immigration", content: "The number of border-crossers taken into U.S. custody topped 100,000 for the second consecutive month in April, U.S. border officials said Wednesday, deepening the crisis that has derailed President Trump’s immigration agenda and has defied his myriad attempts to fix it.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) detained 109,144 migrants along the boundary with Mexico last month, a 6 percent increase from March, as monthly arrests reached their highest point since 2007. Unauthorized border crossings have more than doubled in the past year, and they are on pace to exceed 1 million on an annual basis, as Guatemalan and Honduran families continue streaming north in record numbers with the expectation they will be quickly processed and released from custody.

“Our apprehension numbers are off the charts,” Carla Provost, chief of the Border Patrol, said in testimony to senators in Washington on Wednesday afternoon. “We cannot address this crisis by shifting more resources. It’s like holding a bucket under a faucet. It doesn’t matter how many buckets we have if we can’t turn off the flow.”

“My greatest concern is that we will no longer be able to deliver consequences and we will lose control of the border,” Provost said.

Trump has treated the monthly publication of border enforcement statistics as a performance index for his administration’s immigration policies. The steady drumbeat of bad news has left him fuming and his administration scrambling for solutions. Trump’s fury contributed to the removal of Kirstjen Nielsen as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security last month as part of a wider shake-up at the agency, with Trump vowing to go in a “tougher direction.”

Toughness, for Trump, includes the deployment of razor wire, thousands of U.S. soldiers and plans to build hundreds of miles of barriers, as well as threats to close the border entirely. But physical measures have done little to discourage Central Americans who are fleeing grim poverty, endemic violence and crop failures and see their relatives and neighbors successfully completing the journey to the United States.

White House officials have since turned to tightening the asylum claim process to make it more difficult for migrants to seek refuge in the country, have vowed to crack down on visa overstays and are considering several options that would allow the administration to detain families longer and deport migrants in the country illegally faster.

Yet the evidence of the U.S. immigration system being overwhelmed continues to build.

DHS officials for the first time this week said the agency is running out of space to jail single adult migrants, who arrived in April at the highest level in five years. One DHS official warned of a complete border breakdown if single adults who cross illegally can no longer be detained and deported.

DHS officials already have declared a “breaking point” for U.S. border agents and infrastructure, with court rulings and a crunch of detention space forcing them to release the vast majority of migrant family members and children into the interior of the United States. Border officials view single adult migrants as the one remaining demographic they can deter by “applying consequences.”

“If we were forced to release single adults, our prediction is you would see a draw or a flow that we’ve never seen before in our history,” the DHS official said.

May has historically been one of the busiest months of the year for illegal crossings, and officials say the number of migrants taken into custody has drifted even higher in the past 10 days. CBP made 5,075 arrests on Saturday, the highest one-day total since the numbers started climbing in 2017, officials said.

There was a relatively modest uptick in the rate of border interdictions last month — after a 35 percent jump from February to March — but U.S. officials are bracing for the numbers to go as high as 150,000 per month this summer if their deterrence efforts do not work.

The migrant families who cross the border appear to know that they have a relatively easy path to release into the United States, and they have been turning themselves over to U.S. agents, the first step in starting an asylum application process that protects them from quick deportation.

The share of those border-crossers who show up in large groups has put additional strain on U.S. agents. Border Patrol has taken in 135 large groups consisting of 100 or more migrants in the past seven months, 10 times the total during all of 2018, according to the latest statistics. On April 30, a group of 421 adults and children crossed in the El Paso area, the single-largest group CBP has ever seen, officials said.

Officials say many of the migrants continue to stream north from Guatemala and Honduras, countries where massive numbers of residents are fleeing extreme poverty and domestic perils.

“Guatemala and Honduras have seen over 1 percent of their total population migrate to the U.S. in the first seven months of this fiscal year,” acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan, Nielsen’s replacement, said in a speech Tuesday that outlined his border strategy. “One department of Guatemala, Huehuetenango, has seen almost 35,000 of its residents — close to 3 percent of the population — migrate to the U.S. in that time frame.”

He cited a U.S.-funded Vanderbilt University study that found 1 in 4 Guatemalans are interested in emigrating. Of those who want to emigrate, 85 percent said the United States is their preferred destination, McAleenan said.

“That’s over 4 million Guatemalans who intend to migrate to the United States,” McAleenan said.

McAleenan has been working with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, on an immigration bill that will contain provisions to overhaul the legal immigration system as well as measures to address the current crisis. McAleenan said it was part of “an aggressive and holistic strategy” that would require “working together” with Mexico and Central America to achieve results.

Trump has directed the State Department to sever aid to Central American nations in response to the border surge. At other moments of pique he has blasted Mexican leaders, saying they are “doing nothing” to deal with the wave of migration moving through their country.

The acting DHS secretary said his four-pillar plan includes legislative changes to “eliminate the magnet for the most vulnerable migrants,” as well as adding barriers, technology and personnel along the U.S.-Mexico border.

The third and fourth pillars, he said, would require partnerships with Mexico, to increase its immigration enforcement capacities, and with Central American leaders, to address “push” factors driving migrants to leave.

The White House last week said it would ask Congress for $4.5 billion in supplemental funding to cope with the border crisis, and the biggest share of those funds — $2.8 billion — would cover the cost of sheltering underage migrants who arrive without a parent or guardian. Last month, more than 8,800 “unaccompanied alien children” crossed the border.

CBP officials also have set up overflow tent camps at military sites in El Paso and the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas to alleviate dangerous overcrowding in Border Patrol holding cells.", link: "https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/from-the-border-more-frustrating-immigration-numbers-for-president-trump/2019/05/08/ad6ac140-71a7-11e9-9eb4-0828f5389013_story.html", img_url: "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2019/04/09/BreakingNews/Images/032719-BorderChaos-SF21-001.JPG", slant: "Left")

Article.create!(title: "Renewable energy part of Offshore Technology event in Texas", author: "L.M. Sixel and Marissa Luck", source: "Washington Post", summary: "One of the world’s largest oil industry conferences has a rising star — renewable energy.", topic: "Technology", content: "One of the world’s largest oil industry conferences has a rising star — renewable energy.

The Houston Chronicle reports at this week’s Offshore Technology Conference, companies that sell equipment to oil and gas drillers are pitching their products for renewable energy, too. Attendees are crowding into panel discussions to hear engineers and geoscientists present research on techniques to make renewable energy more cost effective. Wind developers are flying in from California and New York to opine on the nascent, but growing offshore wind energy market in the United States.

Renewable energy has arrived in full force at OTC, which runs through Thursday, as more traditional oil producers — and the service and equipment companies that serve them — look to diversify their portfolios.

Global offshore wind energy is poised to grow dramatically in the coming decades, with cumulative investments in offshore wind projected to reach $350 billion by 2030 and nearly $1.5 trillion by 2050, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. And traditional oil companies increasingly want a piece of that burgeoning market.


Doreen Harris, who oversees large scale renewable projects for the state of New York, said she wasn’t surprised to be asked to speak at the historically oil-centric OTC this year.

“It’s the oil and gas companies that are in some ways most interested in offshore wind developments,” she said, calling it the “manifestation of the market.”

Offshore wind has taken off in the United Kingdom, Europe and China, but is only now beginning to break into the U.S. market. Only one offshore wind farm operates in U.S. waters, a five-turbine development off the coast of Rhode Island capable of producing 30 megawatts of electricity, enough to power about 6,000 Texas homes on a summer day.

But as the cost of offshore wind production falls and more governments set ambitious targets for renewable energies, the business opportunity in the U.S. is huge. Oil companies such as the Norwegian firm Equinor and the European supermajor Royal Dutch Shell want a piece of the growth.

The U.S. has the technical resource potential to develop more than 2,000 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity, almost double the nation’s current electricity use, according to the Department of Energy. Over the next decade, seven East Coast states are projected to spend almost $70 billion on capital expenditures building nearly 20 gigawatts of offshore wind generating capacity to meet aggressive renewable targets, according to a University of Delaware study.

The federal government, meanwhile, is laying the groundwork to start bidding rights to build offshore wind off the California coast.

Companies are now willing to pay more for offshore wind leases in federal waters. In December, companies agreed to pay $135 million to lease blocks off the coast of Massachusetts, setting a record that was more than triple the price paid in a previous federal offshore wind auction in 2016. This year, the state of New York received a record number of proposals from companies wanting to build wind energy developments offshore.


Falling costs for offshore wind are making projects more commercially viable — and more attractive to investors. Since the Rhode Island wind farm was built in 2016, the cost of offshore wind power in the United States has plunged nearly 75 percent, according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a professional association based in New York.

Energy companies are looking to develop deep-water wind projects for some of the same reasons they looked offshore to drill for oil, said Dominique Roddier, Chief Technology Officer at the California-based deep-water wind developer Principle Power, which also sent representatives to OTC. The ocean offers a bigger field and often better resources, Roddier said.

In the case of wind, it blows more steadily offshore than onshore.

Roddier, who started his career at Exxon Mobil, said more engineers, geoscientists and developers like him are switching from offshore oil to offshore wind. They can apply some of the same skills, philosophies, safety standards and technical know-how to renewable energy, he added.


In years past, the British company Survitec played up its life boats and other personal protection gear to the oil company representatives at OTC. But this year, the company decided to focus on how it supports the renewables industry with protective clothing for power production platforms.

The company is betting that the offshore U.S. wind industry is on the verge of taking off, much like the United Kingdom was a few years ago before becoming one of the world’s leaders in offshore wind production. Survitec, which featured big photos of offshore wind turbines in its booth, aims to become an early vendor to companies eager to get in on the ground floor of wind production off the U.S. coast.

“I’d like to think we have all the right products so when someone comes in here from the United States, we’re ready to go,” said Kevin Laing, head of energy sales.

But exhibitors know they’re still dealing with an oil and gas crowd. The key, vendors say, is to show they can still provide products and services for drilling such as corrosion monitoring and down-hole imaging, but also adapt them to renewables.

The Dutch company Emce Winches, for example, sells winches used to lift and lower heavy objects from oil platform. But it also promotes the flexibility of its winches, which are used in assembling and installing wind turbines.

“People don’t come here and say, ‘I’m a wind mill manufacturer. Can you help me on this?’” said Peter-Paul Stokvis, the company’s chief executive.

In another part of the exhibition hall, conference goers gathered around a model of the core product of Amsterdam-based SBM Offshore: a floating production, storage and off-loading vessel used for offshore oil production. But a few feet away, another model was drawing attention: a floating wind turbine.

The turbine is made with many of the same parts that SBM uses to make deep sea vessels designed to process and store oil produced offshore, including floating buoys for stabilization. SBM has sold a French utility three, 8-megawatt offshore turbines that will be located off the coast of Marseille in 2021.

“Oil and gas will still be around for another 25 to 30 years,” said the company’s press officer Paula Farquharson-Blengino, but the energy mix will shift.

“Renewables,” she said, “will become the bigger act down the road.”", link: "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/renewable-energy-part-of-offshore-technology-event-in-texas/2019/05/08/321a53a6-7199-11e9-9331-30bc5836f48e_story.html", img_url: "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/F1927D30QfzVeIEyF3dcJCElfIU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DUC4HYTR2AI6TEZRGC6FQNXURY.jpg", slant: "Left")

Article.create!(title: "Strike by Uber and Lyft drivers has potential to disrupt travel for thousands", author: "Luz Lazo", source: "The Washington Post", summary: "Drivers in major U.S. cities are striking over wages and working conditions.", topic: "Travel", content: "Getting an Uber or a Lyft may be impossible — or take longer and cost more — Wednesday when drivers for both companies plan to strike in major U.S. cities to protest what they say are unfair wages and poor working conditions.

Thousands of drivers in at least eight cities — including Los Angeles, New York and Washington — are planning to shut off their apps and join rallies outside company headquarters and regional offices, according to labor organizers.

The national day of action comes as Uber prepares for an initial public offering this week, just weeks after Lyft hit the public market.

It is unclear how the labor action might affect travel, but experts say disruptions are likely in cities where the app-based rides have become a critical mode of transportation. Riders should anticipate surge pricing and longer wait times due to a possible shortage of drivers, they say. In some markets, drivers are asking passengers to support their cause by boycotting the services in cases where drivers are working.

“This is an act of solidarity with drivers across the country, and really across the world, who are suffering with poverty wages,” said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which is helping organize thousands of drivers in New York.

In preparation for possible service disruptions, some airport authorities said Monday they were urging passengers to plan ahead to use public transportation where available. In the Washington area, officials said they were working with taxi dispatch teams at Reagan National and Dulles International airports to ensure that extra taxis were available in the event of increased demand Wednesday.

“We’ll have extra dispatchers available to help manage any increased crowds in the taxi lines on the curb and ensure that customers can get on their way as quickly and safely as possible,” said Christina Saull, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. “At Reagan National, we always encourage passengers to consider using Metrorail as a good alternative to ground transportation — that advice would definitely apply to Wednesday as well.”

There is a Metro stop at National; bus service is available at Dulles. Metro said it is planning to have extra trains and buses on standby in the event of a ridership surge.

The work stoppage is part of a growing national campaign for better wages for the independent contractors who support millions of trips daily in the United States and abroad. The services have become a preferred choice for many travelers in recent years — for daily commutes, trips to and from the airport, and transportation to entertainment and nightlife. As the ride-hailing services have expanded, they also have become critical for public transit agencies in filling service gaps or providing paratransit services.

An Uber spokeswoman declined to speculate on the possible effects of a strike, and Lyft did not respond to a request for comment Monday. In a statement, Uber said: 'Drivers are at the heart of our service — we can’t succeed without them — and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road. Whether it’s more consistent earnings, stronger insurance protections or fully-funded four-year degrees for drivers or their families, we’ll continue working to improve the experience for and with drivers.' The strike was first called by drivers in Los Angeles, who have held protests in recent weeks over a wage restructuring there for Uber drivers, who had their per-mile rates cut by 25 percent. Drivers in other countries, including England, are joining the strike, with some holding daylong work stoppages and others joining only for a few hours.

In New York, as many as 10,000 drivers are joining a two-hour morning commute work stoppage, organizers with the New York Taxi Workers Alliance said. Although New York drivers won a recent battle when the city enacted a law that mandates ride-hail companies pay them at least $17.22 an hour after expenses, organizers said the rates across the board are below a living wage.

“The wages are so unpredictable and so low, it’s very difficult to make a living,” said Henock Wonderse, 40, a Virginia resident who has driven with Uber since 2012. He plans to shut down his Uber operation Wednesday, joining other drivers in the Washington area at an evening rally at National Airport. “We want better pay, and we hope the passengers join us to get that message across.

Besides better wages, drivers are calling for a more transparent wage structure, attention to safety concerns and a right to appeal “unjust firings” with little to no notice. A Georgetown University study of 40 Washington Uber drivers found some thought the work “unsustainable,” with one-third reporting assaults or safety concerns and saying they went into debt to drive on the platform.

Uber has reported that its drivers have earned more than $78.2 billion on the platform since 2015, and $1.2 billion in tips. The company says that it offers financial rewards for qualifying drivers and that drivers can track their earnings in real time. On safety, Uber cites a number of features, including an emergency button, share trip feature and 911 integration technology in more than 40 cities.

But drivers say they can barely make ends meet after expenses such as gas and vehicle maintenance. And many have problems calculating their compensation, said Katie J. Wells, the Georgetown researcher who led the study in Washington. Uber has reduced the base rate that is paid to drivers since it launched and added fees including a “rider safety” fee, she said.

“There are real safety and financial concerns in the workplace,” Wells said.", link: "https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/05/07/strike-by-uber-lyft-drivers-wednesday-has-potential-disrupt-travel-thousands/", img_url: "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lZ_dLSDnlWGAX8plVcjPPhobFMQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SC7JPOC33AI6TGGUQRAIRUJV6I.jpg", slant: "Left")

", topic: "Travel", content: "Kent Johnson knew the power of seeing the world when he took his first international trip at age 7. Now, he’s disrupting the travel industry to create space for black people.

The Baltimore native co-founded Black & Abroad, a collective that makes travel more accessible for and catered to black people by offering exposure, experiences and resources. Johnson and Eric Martin launched the website in 2015 when they recognized the lack of black representation in travel marketing and of opportunities within the industry. They created a space where black people feel empowered to travel anywhere in the world while redefining the face of travel.

But Johnson doesn’t solely focus his mission abroad. He makes room for the diaspora in the states as well with his podcast “Ungentrified.” With an increasing number of black neighborhoods becoming less black and long-term residents being forced out of their communities, Johnson explores current cultural and political events with guests to ensure our voices are heard.

For “We Built This,” Johnson spoke to HuffPost about the power of black people disrupting the travel industry, the roadblocks that prevent many from access and drawing inspiration from Matthew Henson and Victor Hugo Green.

What have you built?

I’ve built a couple of things. I’m the co-founder of a platform that’s dedicated to celebrating, exposing, inspiring black millennials to see the world. I’ve also built a podcast around giving voices to those who may not have them in my community and in doing those two things, I’ve built a pretty happy life for myself.

What was the catalyst for you in building both of these platforms?

Well, for Black & Abroad, the travel company, Google was the thing that pushed me. I would search for destinations and things to do, and I wouldn’t see people that looked like me and it frustrated me to no end. So, I came into it wanting to really change Google results. I wanted to see all kinds of people experiencing the world. I didn’t want it to look just one way, so that was really what pushed me to create Black & Abroad.

For “Ungentrified,” my podcast, I knew a whole bunch of dope people, and I wanted everybody else to know these people too. I wanted to document these really interesting stories and be a space for these stories where they were unfiltered and unburdened by outside influence. So that was why I named it “Ungentrified,” I was unburdened by outside influence, so yeah those were really the two things that drove me to create those platforms.

These platforms you’ve built are meant and seen as a place where black people can hold space in realms in which we haven’t been able to before. First, with “Ungentrified,” can you tell me about that name? What does “Ungentrified” mean?

Once I decided that the podcast was gonna be the way that I made that moment happen for my community, I was trying to think of a word that kinda embodied freedom of thought for black people and gentrification is always a buzzword for us whether it’s gentrification of the mind or of the physical property. These are things that we talk about all the time in some way, shape or form, so I wanted people to know immediately and in one word that this was a space where none of that was gonna happen.

And I felt like that word embodied it perfectly and nobody had the dot com yet, so that was always a reason for picking it, but I thought it was a perfect embodiment of what I was trying to achieve and it would let people know immediately before even clicking play on that first episode that they knew what they were getting into.

Shifting gears to Black & Abroad, what were some of the places that you did travel when you were young, if you did?

Yeah, I did travel a lot as a kid. It was one thing that was very key in my family. It was very set into tradition for us early on that you don’t limit yourself to your four corners of your block. So, the first trip I took as a kid, international trip was to Germany to live with my dad for a year. My mom and my dad weren’t together and my dad was in the Air Force.

So, way back in the day, I actually drove up to New York from Baltimore and flew from here to Germany and got a year of a whole new experience, and I think that was what really kinda kicked off the addiction, I guess you could say. From that moment, I was always gone and then I’ve been lucky enough to live in different states in the country, so I lived in California where Mexico was down the street and had that.

Something that I could see a whole new country or a whole other country from my window when I lived in San Diego, so knowing ... I think the proximity of another country made the rest of the world seem like it was just as close. And the fears around traveling just didn’t set in on me. I’ve never had an issue around that and I think it’s those moments that put me in the position to create something like Black & Abroad, because I think someone in that position needed to be fearless around the idea of black people seeing the world.

A lot of black people don’t get a chance, especially at a young age to see the world or to view the world as their oyster. Did you recognize that when you were younger or did it take some time?

I did recognize that access to travel wasn’t something that was prevalent in my community. Whether it was in conversation with friends, because you realize as you travel more, your conversations change, your ideas change, your perception of how things work changes, so yeah the frustrating part about that is a lot of it deals with access.

So, in high school, if your school was in an area that wasn’t getting resources, it was very likely that study abroad programs weren’t being presented to you there, so you didn’t get the normalcy of travel that other communities may have and that plays into it a lot. I tell a lot of younger people that I meet, like college students, things like that, like the thing I wish I had done in undergrad was to do a study abroad program. That’s the one regret I had.

 I blew through undergrad, was working multiple jobs to pay tuition and I wish that I had taken a semester for myself and had that opportunity. So, I always press that on them, because it may not have been pressed on them before. I have been in many situations where an opportunity wasn’t given to me, because of an assumption. And I know that that assumption was based off my skin tone or my address and it shouldn’t be like that.

And those are the little blocks that end up becoming a wall for people and that’s really another kinda tone to what we do with Black & Abroad is to kinda knock those things down, create a normalcy around the fact that yeah, black people are all over the world and having these unique and important moments.

What is the importance of black people seeing that and having the access to the privilege of travel?

So, the importance of black people being able to see that, I mean it’s simple. A lot of times, you don’t know something is available to you until you see somebody who looks like you doing it. When I, many moons ago, one of my other jobs, I taught. I taught middle school English, and I would be very adamant about bringing in books that featured African-American characters because that was the makeup of my classroom.

Because I wanted them to have stories that could resonate with them on all levels. I’m reading about someone who looks like me. They’re having an experience that I could see myself having now, just off of that little thing. And that’s key to, I think, why we’ve had so much success with Black & Abroad is because we didn’t limit it to one black experience. My co-founder, Eric Martin, we’re two guys, so we have a very limited understanding and experience of the black experience.

There are hundreds of thousands of millions of other experiences that make up the black experience and that’s one thing that we don’t normally get in media is a multitude of experiences. There’s one black experience that gets put out in media, and it’s a frustration that I think a lot of people are working to overcome. That’s why you see Donald Glover’s Atlanta doing so well because it gives normalcy to different black experiences and they’re all black.

So, with Black & Abroad, we’re very adamant about doing that. We coulda made it just about our experience, but then that would’ve been very limited and it wouldn’t have had the impact we wanted. We wanted to talk about the single mom who was traveling with her kid for a year and what her experience was like. We wanted to talk about what it’s like to have your hair grabbed in Asia and what that experience feels like.

Wanted to talk about safety for people of color in certain countries in the world. We wanted to have those experiences and really re-use our platform as a crowd sourcing space where everyone from these different backgrounds and different travel moments can come in and share and really express how they’ve seen the world and now we have this new understanding of the black experience just based off of that.

Who are the black history makers, the elders, who helped inspire you to continue to do the work that you do?

The elders and the ancestors or a new term that I learned, the “grandcestors” that really helped me out, Matthew Henson, is one that sticks close to me, because he’s one of the first-known, documented black travelers and explorers, so I always stick to him and always do what would Matthew Henson do? Kinda that cheesy moment, but he sticks out to me. The creator of the Green Book [Victor Hugo Green], where they knew that that kind of information was needed so that black people felt safe traveling up and down the East Coast.

Those are two people who stick out to me as kinda drivers for the work behind Black & Abroad.

What’s next for Black & Abroad? What’s next for you?

So the podcast is expanding. I have a project I’ve done with South Africa that I’m excited that’s gonna be dropping around the creative scene in Johannesburg, so I’m really excited about that. I’m working on taking a script that I wrote a long time ago and putting it into book form and for Black & Abroad, what’s next, so our focus for the last two years has been on identifying destinations in the diaspora to bring a group of travelers there and have them have an experience for the week.

And not just your run-of-the-mill tourist experience, but really local, immersive experiences and one thing that we do differently is we kinda take a real-world approach to how we put the group together and we hand pick the people; so that we have representation from all walks of black life, and we put them in this experience and have them go through it together. We do things like we don’t tell them who they’re traveling with until the day before the trip and we do that intentionally, because we know that in this day and age, whenever you get a little bit of contact information for somebody, you’re on LinkedIn, you’re on Twitter, you’re on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest.

Anywhere you can to find out more about them and you feel like you know people before you’ve actually met them and that changes how you interact with people, so we really look at them as social experiments in places all over the world, but we’ve been very specific just in the initial rollout in being places in the diaspora and we work with local businesses trying to make the dollar or the rand or the peso extend as long as it can within the local communities within those places at least while we’re there.

So, our next trip is, well trips rather for this year, we’ve added Ghana because this year’s the year of return, so we’ll be taking a group there in August and a group there in December for New Year’s.", link: "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bhm-kent-johnson_n_5c6ad324e4b05c889d21f800", img_url: "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c6c322d250000580480a622.jpeg?ops=scalefit_970_noupscale", slant: "Left")

The NRA’s yearly convention is generally a time for the gun group to pat itself on the back while whining about feeling threatened by those seeking stronger gun control. But on Saturday morning in Indianapolis, the convention opened with a somber tone. The organization’s First Vice President Richard Childress read a letter from North ― who was not in attendance ― to say that the retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel will not seek reelection. Childress said he was not aware of the decision until the night before.

“I hope to be with you today as NRA president endorsed for reelection. I’m now informed that that will not happen,” North wrote in the letter.

On Friday night, infighting within the NRA hit a climax as top executive Wayne LaPierre called for the removal of North after saying the president was attempting to oust him by releasing “damaging” information, The Associated Press reported.

“The extortion was simple: resign or there will be destructive allegations made against me and the NRA,” LaPierre wrote in a letter to the board. “Alarmed and disgusted, I refused the offer.”

In his own letter read aloud Saturday, North said board members “expressed concern about the amount of money the NRA was paying to the Brewer law firm.”

The removal of North comes after a damning new report by The Trace in conjunction with The New Yorker that outlined how the lobbying group has willfully obscured where its money goes, made dubious payout arrangements and found itself deep in the pockets of public relations firm Ackerman McQueen.

Following The Trace’s report, Shannon Watts of Moms Demand Action announced that the gun safety group Everytown had filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service over the NRA’s tax-exempt status.

If the allegations are true, North warned in the letter, “The NRA’s nonprofit status is threatened.”

“Wayne LaPierre works for the NRA,” Marion Hammer, a former NRA president, told the AP. “His loyalty is to the NRA. Oliver North is employed by Ackerman McQueen, a vendor of the NRA. And it is clear that his loyalty is to Ackerman McQueen.”

Another NRA casualty was Steve Hart, a longtime lawyer for the board. He was suspended from his position Saturday shortly before North’s announcement, The Daily Beast reported.

These devastating blows to the gun group are little surprise to those following its downward trajectory: In 2017, the group reported a loss of $55 million in income as membership plummeted. More recently, a HuffPost investigation found that an NRA official was in contact with a prominent Sandy Hook conspiracy theorist in an attempt to cast doubt on the facts of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting that left 17 people dead. The NRA declined to say whether it fired that official.

Article.create!(title: "Supreme Court Refuses to Block Ban on Bump Stocks", author: "Adam Liptak", source: "The New York Times", summary: "The Supreme Courtrefused to block a Trump administration initiative banning bump stocks, the attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire in sustained, rapid bursts.", topic: "Gun Control", content: "The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to block a Trump administration initiative banning bump stocks, the attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire in sustained, rapid bursts.

The court’s action, in a one-sentence order, means that the regulation will remain in force while challenges to it move forward in the courts. There were no noted dissents.

The case concerns executive power, not the Second Amendment. The lead plaintiff, Gun Owners of America, which describes itself as “the ‘no compromise’ gun lobby,” argued that the administration had exceeded its authority by banning bump stocks under federal laws that largely ban machine guns. (The National Rifle Association was not a party to the suit.)

Bump stocks work by harnessing a firearm’s recoil energy to allow it to keep firing after a single pull of the trigger. The Justice Department has said this transforms semiautomatic weapons into fully automatic machine guns.

The regulation, which went into effect on Tuesday, bans the sale or possession of bump stocks, which were used by a gunman to massacre 58 people and wound hundreds of others at a Las Vegas concert in October 2017.

Under the regulation, Americans who own bump stocks have 90 days to destroy their devices or to turn them in to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

In instructions posted on its website, the bureau suggested “crushing, melting or shredding” as acceptable methods of destruction.

Michael E. Hammond, a lawyer with Gun Owners of America, said the group “wouldn’t advocate that anyone violate the law.” But he added that the regulation may be hard to enforce.

“My guess, from the states that have enacted bump stock bans, is that most of the 500,000 people that have bump stocks are not going to turn them in, if history is any indication,” Mr. Hammond said.

The Justice Department initially decided that the executive branch did not have the authority to ban bump stocks without congressional action. It later changed course, determining it could ban the devices on its own.

What Is a Bump Stock and How Does It Work?
“Bump stocks” are attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster, almost like machine guns. Twelve of the rifles found in the hotel room of the Las Vegas gunman were fitted with the devices.

Gun owners challenged the regulation in a federal trial court in Michigan, saying that federal law did not allow the executive branch’s action. They added that the regulation would require the destruction of devices worth more than $100 million.

Judge Paul L. Maloney, of the Federal District Court in Kalamazoo, Mich., last week refused to block the regulation. “Congress restricts access to machine guns because of the threat the weapons pose to public safety,” he wrote. “Restrictions on bump stocks advance the same interest. All of the public is at risk, including the smaller number of bump stock owners.”

On Monday, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, rejected a request from the challengers for a stay of the regulation while an appeal from Judge Maloney’s decision moved forward.

The panel acknowledged that the plaintiffs “will suffer irreparable harm.” But it said that “the public interest in safety supports denial of a stay pending appeal.”

The plaintiffs then turned to the Supreme Court. “This case represents the single biggest A.T.F. seizure of private property in history,” their lawyers wrote, “made even more noxious because all existing bump stocks were manufactured and purchased in accordance with A.T.F. rulings approving their sale.”

“The protection of the public and law enforcement officers from the proliferation of prohibited firearms is a bedrock foundation of federal firearms legislation,” he wrote, adding that the regulation “promotes that public interest by protecting the public from the dangers posed by machine guns prohibited by federal law.”

The regulation has been challenged in other courts, too, but so far none of them have ruled for the plaintiffs. After a federal trial judge in Washington refused to enter a preliminary injunction, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit did issue a temporary stay of the regulation, but it applied only to the plaintiffs in the case before it.

The challengers in that case, Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, No. 18A964, asked the Supreme Court to intervene. “Hundreds of thousands of citizens,” they wrote, “will be required to surrender or destroy their property or face felony charges for possession of devices that were unquestionably legal under A.T.F.’s construction of the statute for the past 85 years and A.T.F.’s prior written rulings stating as much.”

“No person,” their brief said, “should have to face the threat of felony prosecution and deprivation of their property due to the rushed and arbitrary time frame A.T.F. placed on these proceedings.”

Roberts Jr., noting that the appeals court had already imposed a partial stay, denied the application on Tuesday.", link: "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/us/politics/supreme-court-bump-stocks.html", img_url: "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/27/us/politics/27dc-scotus-bump/merlin_134352866_0a56bf88-b08b-468a-afe6-747c477d74d2-jumbo.jpg", slant: "Left")

Article.create!(title: "Americans Borrowed $88 Billion to Pay for Health Care Last Year, Survey Finds", author: "Karen Zraick", source: "The New York Times", summary: "Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a Democratic health care plan last week. About 70 percent of respondents in a new survey said they did not have confidence in their elected officials to lower health care costs.", topic: "Health", content: "Americans borrowed an estimated $88 billion over the last year to pay for health care, according to a survey released on Tuesday by Gallup and the nonprofit West Health.

The survey also found that one in four Americans have skipped treatment because of the cost, and that nearly half fear bankruptcy in the event of a health emergency.

There was a partisan divide when respondents were asked whether they believed that the American health care system is among the best in the world: Among Republicans, 67 percent of respondents said they believed so; that number was 38 percent among Democrats.

But Democrats and Republicans had similar responses about putting off medical treatment. Asked if they had deferred treatment because of the cost, 27 percent of Democrats said they had, compared with 21 percent of Republicans and 30 percent of independents.

Respondents from across the political spectrum also reported pessimism about their leaders’ abilities to reduce health care costs. About 70 percent of respondents said they had no confidence in their elected officials to bring prices down. And 77 percent said they were concerned that rising health care costs would damage the American economy.

“Our data shows an American public that’s beaten down from this really serious issue,” said Dan Witters, a senior researcher at Gallup.

At the same time, 64 percent of respondents said they were mostly satisfied with their experiences in the health care system. When asked if they were satisfied with how well the system was serving Americans generally, only 39 percent said they were.

The survey’s authors noted that Americans’ feelings were complicated and at times conflicted. But one thing was clear: High health care costs had created significant anxiety.

Even among households earning $180,000 or more a year, a third of respondents said they were concerned about the specter of personal bankruptcy because of a health crisis. (There has been fierce debate among researchers about the extent to which health care costs can be blamed for bankruptcies.)

Many American families earning less than that, of course, feel the effects of high health care costs acutely. They are forced to cut back on other expenses to pay for health care, or skip appointments and prescription refills, creating health risks down the road.

Twelve percent of respondents said they had borrowed money for care, including 11 percent of those with health insurance, who may still face high deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses.

Most survey respondents said they believed that Americans were paying too much for health care relative to what they receive. Asked to choose between a hypothetical freeze in their health care costs or a 10 percent increase in household income, 61 percent of respondents chose the freeze. Those in low-income households were most likely to choose that option.

“When we’re talking about health care and the debate right now, it usually bifurcates between the financial impact of health care or the health outcomes themselves,” said Tim Lash, chief strategy officer for West Health, a nonpartisan nonprofit that aims to lower health care prices.

“But those two things intersect at access,” which can have dire health consequences, he said.

The organization believes that Congress should allow Medicare to negotiate directly with drug companies; that there should be more transparency about the prices of medicines and procedures; and that the health care industry should shift toward “value-based care” — in which doctors are paid based on patient outcomes — rather than the current “fee-for-service” model.


Mr. Lash noted that other wealthy countries spend much less on health care than the United States does, while achieving better outcomes in areas like life expectancy and infant mortality. Although about 87 percent of Americans have health insurance, according to data from Gallup, an individual’s plan may not cover all costs associated with treatment.

President Trump, who has sought to undo the Affordable Care Act, tweeted about high deductibles under the law on Monday morning, promising that “Good things are going to happen!” and tagging several Republican lawmakers.

The administration asked a federal appeals court to invalidate the law last week, while Democrats announced a health care bill that builds on the Affordable Care Act and seeks to lower premiums, among other goals.

The partnership between West Health and Gallup, the analytics and consulting company, was a first. The survey results are based on phone interviews conducted in English and Spanish in early 2019 with a random sample of 3,500 adults across the country. The margin of sampling error ranged from one to two percentage points for results based on the total sample, and three to five percentage points for results based on subgroups such as political identity or income level, so differences of less than those amounts are statistically insignificant.

Gallup and West Health said they would conduct similar surveys in the coming years.", link: "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/health/americans-health-care-debt-borrowing.html", img_url: "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/01/us/01xp-healthcare/merlin_152653032_b47ed4ff-be6e-4e38-bd24-3324375f4ced-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp", slant: "Left")


Article.create!(title: "San Francisco Had an Ambitious Plan to Tackle School Segregation. It Made It Worse.", author: "Dana Goldstein", source: "The New York Times", summary: "San Francisco allows parents to apply to any school in the district, having done away with traditional school zoning in an effort to desegregate its classrooms.", topic: "Education", content: "Like many parents in San Francisco, Melvin Canas and Delfina Ramirez described applying to public kindergarten as a part-time job. They researched schools all over the city for their daughter, Cinthya; took unpaid hours off their jobs as cooks to tour over a dozen; and ultimately ranked 15 of them on her application.

San Francisco allows parents to apply to any elementary school in the district, having done away with traditional school zoning 18 years ago in an effort to desegregate its classrooms. Give parents more choices, the thinking was, and low-income and working-class students of color like Cinthya would fill more seats at the city’s most coveted schools.

But last month, Cinthya’s parents, who are Hispanic, found out she had been admitted to their second-to-last choice, a school where less than a third of students met standards on state reading and math tests last year. Only 3 percent were white.

Results like these have soured many on the city’s school enrollment plan, which is known here as “the lottery” and was once considered a national model.

“Our current system is broken,” said Stevon Cook, president of the district Board of Education, which, late last year, passed a resolution to overhaul the process. “We’ve inadvertently made the schools more segregated.”

For decades, the education mantra from presidential campaign trails to local school board elections has been the same: Your ZIP code should not determine the quality of your school. Few cities have gone further in trying to make that ideal a reality than San Francisco. But as education leaders from New York to Dallas to San Antonio vow to integrate schools, and as presidential candidates like Joseph R. Biden Jr. are being asked to answer for their records on school segregation, San Francisco’s ambitious plan offers a cautionary tale. Parental choice has not been the leveler of educational opportunity it was made out to be. Affluent parents are able to take advantage of the system in ways low-income parents cannot, or they opt out of public schools altogether. What happened in San Francisco suggests that without remedies like wide-scale busing, or school zones drawn deliberately to integrate, school desegregation will remain out of reach.

After families submit their kindergarten applications, ranking as many school choices as they like across the city, a computer algorithm makes assignments. Those from neighborhoods where students have scored low on state tests get first dibs at their top-ranked programs. Each child gets an address-based priority at one school, but it is considered only after those with test-score priority are offered seats.

The district had previously used busing to try to desegregate schools, under a 1983 agreement with the N.A.A.C.P. But a group of Chinese-American families sued in the 1990s, saying their children were being denied seats at elite campuses. The city settled the case by devising a choice-based enrollment process meant to be race-neutral but still achieve integration.

Research shows that desegregation can drive learning gains for students of all races. And on paper, San Francisco’s system showed promise. In recent years, it succeeded in breaking up racial concentrations at a handful of schools.

But over all, many parents and city leaders consider it a disappointment. The district’s schools were more racially segregated in 2015 than they were in 1990, even though the city’s neighborhoods have become more integrated, research shows. That pattern holds true in many of the nation’s largest cities, according to an analysis by Ryan W. Coughlan, an assistant professor of sociology at Guttman Community College in New York.

Segregation looks different in San Francisco than in other parts of the country. The district is one of the most diverse in the nation: 35 percent of students are Asian, 27 percent are Hispanic, 15 percent are white and 7 percent are African-American. Schools here are not racially monolithic. But over the past several decades, white, Asian and Hispanic students, on average, have been clustered in schools with more children of their own races.

While black children were slightly less racially isolated in 2015 than in 1990, that was largely a result of their lower enrollment in the district, Professor Coughlan said — a change driven by astronomical housing costs. Even the school district has acknowledged that a system of geographically zoned schools would most likely create more racial integration than the current, choice-driven approach.

There are several reasons the system has not worked as intended. One is a lack of transportation. Fewer than 4,000 of the district’s 54,000 students ride a bus to school. The city’s busing program was reduced in 2010, during the last recession, and has not been restored.

Shurrin Zeng, vice chairwoman of the district’s English Learners Advisory Committee, said location had been the No. 1 factor in her decision to enroll her 10-year-old daughter in the school closest to their home, which is overwhelmingly Hispanic and Asian, and largely low-income. She is not completely happy with the school, but choice, she said, was not meaningful without “more convenient transportation” to ensure access.

And some parents may not have heard about better, far-flung schools. Not everyone has the time to navigate the complex process of researching, touring and ranking campuses. Families who want a different school from the one they are given can try their luck in three more lottery rounds, filing paperwork and managing waiting lists even past the start of the school year, in some cases.

School tours typically take place between 8 and 10 a.m. — prime commuting and work hours — and some of the most desired schools require parents to sign up weeks in advance.

At Rooftop Elementary in the Twin Peaks neighborhood — Mr. Canas and Ms. Ramirez’s first choice for Cinthya — a tour in December was dominated by professional-class parents with flexible schedules. They took in breathtaking views of the San Francisco Bay and strolled past a climbing wall and gardening plots. Jonathan and Sofia Perel, an IT director and a consultant to nonprofits, said they had visited 18 schools.

In contrast, Kenika Eison, a medical assistant, had to show up at schools unannounced during off hours, hoping a principal would come out to talk to her. She ended up enrolling her son Aaden in a charter school close to the clinic where she works, partly because of the school’s good reputation, but also because she would not need to arrange child care in the mornings. Since the district uses neighborhood test scores to determine admissions preferences, some students from low-income and working-class families in San Francisco, like Cinthya, do not get an advantage, while a handful of wealthier students, whose parents happen to live in areas with historically lower test scores, do.

The system benefits gentrifiers, in a city where public housing can be tucked beneath hills studded with multimillion-dollar Victorians.

Anne Zimmerman, a stay-at-home parent and writer, had what others call, sometimes derisively, the “golden ticket.” She and her husband, who works in advertising, moved into their two-bedroom rental in the Potrero Hill neighborhood a decade ago, without realizing their address granted them priority in the school lottery.

This year, their daughter, Vera, was offered admission to their first-choice kindergarten, one of the most requested in the city. The school is 37 percent white and 21 percent low-income. Districtwide, 15 percent of students are white and 55 percent are low-income.

“I feel so very conflicted” about getting an advantage, Ms. Zimmerman said. Both she and her husband are white. “The system was developed to equalize the playing field, and I don’t think it really has done it.”

Those who defend the current system point out that 79 percent of black parents, 79 percent of Filipino parents and 61 percent of Hispanic parents received their first-choice kindergarten for next fall, compared with 48 percent of white parents.

Rionda Batiste is a member of the district’s African-American Parent Advisory Council and a resident of the Bayview, a neighborhood with test-score priority in the lottery. She has been thrilled with the system, which allowed her to enroll two of her children in a school of her choice outside the neighborhood. “Until our schools are being made to have the same resources and quality as the other schools in the other areas, I’m not going to disadvantage her,” Ms. Batiste said of her daughter, Victoria.

But the voices of parents who feel hurt by the lottery hold powerful political sway here. One family of two doctors whose child — like 12 percent of kindergarten applicants — was not admitted to any of the 15 schools they listed, said they would not send their child to the school they were ultimately assigned, which is across the city from their home. The school has struggled with underenrollment and low test scores, and is predominantly black and low-income.

The parents, who are Hispanic and asked not to be named, ended up putting down a deposit for a private school.

About a quarter of the city’s children are enrolled in private school, a higher percentage than in some other major cities, like New York, where it is around 20 percent. The lottery system is thought to be a major reason wealthy parents here opt out of public schools, further worsening segregation.

At the request of the Board of Education, the district is considering how expanded busing could help integrate schools. It is also looking at models in Berkeley, Calif., and Boston, where parents can rank choices from a small group of schools determined by address. San Francisco has already limited choices at the middle-school level, with some success.

Stevon Cook, the board president, said one of the biggest problems with the lottery was “the implicit message that we send” to low-income parents: that schools in their own communities are “inadequate,” and that they should seek to escape them. “We should pour more into those schools to make them attractive,” he said.

The strengths of predominantly black schools, in particular, were often overlooked, said Rachel Norton, a longtime member of the board.

“I don’t want to suggest that every school is of equal quality across the district, but they are closer in quality to each other than people think,” she said.

Mr. Canas, the chef, spoke to teachers at the school where his daughter was admitted, and heard some things he liked about it.

Even if the chances of a dream placement remained low, Mr. Canas said, he would exhaust all options. “I can’t really put a price on my daughter’s education.”", link: "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/san-francisco-school-segregation.html", img_url: "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/26/us/26sfschools-p1/00sfschools-01-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp", slant: "Left")


Article.create!(title: "Betsy DeVos: ‘I Don’t Enjoy The Publicity’ That Comes With My Job", author: "Rebecca Klein", source: "Huffington Post", summary: "The education secretary reflected on life in the spotlight and said the media used her “as clickbait.”", topic: "Education", content: "While addressing an audience at the Education Writers Association conference here on Monday, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said she never imagined she would be the focus of so much public attention.

“I don’t enjoy the publicity that comes with my position,” said DeVos, who has been one of President Donald Trump’s most controversial Cabinet secretaries. “I don’t love being up on stage or on any kind of platform. I’m an introvert.”

She said she also believes the media uses her “name as clickbait.”

“As much as many in the media use my name as clickbait or try to make it all about me, it’s not,” she said. “Education is not about Betsy DeVos nor any other individual.”

It was DeVos’ first time appearing at the Education Writers Association annual national seminar, although she had been invited to it since taking office. Former President Barack Obama’s two education secretaries attended the event every year.

DeVos used the speech to promote her signature priority: the expansion of school choice programs. She pushed her proposal for Education Freedom Scholarships, which has been bolstered through legislation led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and would incentivize states to create programs that would subsidize individual scholarships for school choice. Under this piece of legislation, individuals and businesses could receive tax credits for donating to organizations that grant scholarships. These organizations could then provide scholarships to students to help them pay for education-related costs, like private school.

It would be up to states, though, to shape what exactly their program would look like.

“While it is true that 90% of students today are enrolled in traditional public schools, it’s also true that 60% of their parents say they would prefer something different if only they had the freedom to choose,” DeVos said in her speech.

During a question-and-answer session that followed the speech, DeVos noted that she was talking to both Democrats and Republicans about supporting the proposal.

Opponents have called the proposed scholarship an attack on public education that is designed to push students to private schools. DeVos previously has pushed back on such criticism, calling it “fake news.”

DeVos, who has spent more than two years on the job, has been one of Trump’s longest-lasting Cabinet secretaries. But when asked whether she would stay on for four more years if asked, she joked that she’s not sure her husband would sign on for it.", link: "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/betsy-devos-ewa-school-choice_n_5cd0908fe4b04e275d4e94d3", img_url: "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd0912b1f0000ae063189e7.jpeg?cache=6reuvgrzcj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", slant: "Left")
